# Image-Classification
This code is a machine learning pipeline for classifying car park spaces as either "empty" or "not_empty" using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It involves data preparation, training the classifier with hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating the model's performance. Finally, the best-performing model is saved using pickle for future use.
